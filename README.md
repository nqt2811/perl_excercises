# Perl Exercises Lab

This repository contains a collection of Perl scripting exercises and labs completed during my training. The goal of these exercises is to strengthen my scripting skills, improve automation capabilities, and become more proficient in text processing, system interaction, and file manipulation using Perl.

## 🔧 Topics Covered

- Variables, Scalars, Arrays, Hashes
- Loops & Conditionals
- Regular Expressions
- File I/O
- Subroutines
- System interaction (`system`, `open`, etc.)
- Text processing and filtering
- Command-line arguments

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each `.pl` file corresponds to a specific lab or topic. File names are kept descriptive, such as:

- `lab1_variables.pl`
- `lab2_arrays_and_hashes.pl`
- `lab3_regex.pl`
